Nimbus Web
A professional and responsive 3-page website built with Bootstrap 5.

Project Overview
Nimbus Web is a clean and branded website created to practice and showcase skills in UI/UX design, Bootstrap, and deployment. The design was inspired by the simplicity and elegance of modern Apple/macOS interfaces, focusing on minimalism, consistency, and smooth user experience.

Professional UI with:
Rounded corners
Subtle shadows
Glassmorphism-inspired effect on some cards
Consistent accent color scheme
Animations and Effects
Smooth hover animations on buttons and cards
Navbar style changes on scroll
Accordion with smooth expand/collapse
Transition effects on interactive elements
Reusable Layout → Common navbar and footer across all pages
Navigation Links → All pages are properly linked and consistent

Tools and Technologies Used
HTML5 → Structure of the website
CSS3 → Custom styling and animations (assets/css/style.css)
Bootstrap 5 → Grid system, navbar, forms, cards, accordion, responsive design
JavaScript → Placeholder (assets/js/script.js) for future enhancements
Visual Studio Code → Code editor
Live Server (VS Code Extension) → Local testing and preview
GitHub → Version control and repository hosting
GitHub Pages / Netlify → Deployment and hosting
AI Tools (GitHub Copilot + ChatGPT) → For generating code snippets, refining UI, and speeding up development
